              So happy that even though we barely meet it's always the same when we do. From 4th grade to now I have always felt like I could talk to you about anything and you never judge. So sad we aren't seeing each other in Europe but I'm sure you will have the best day!! I love hanging out at your house and eating your food and talking with Shik and Amaesha and you. You made math group so much more fun just like you do with most other events and classes and I'm so happy I have you in my life!!! Happy happy birthday i love you so much xoxoxo Aditi

          <p data-prevent-swipe class="fragment fade-in scrollable">Nani, Nani, Nani, our darling sweet Nani.  Memories of Nani are plenty both from our ‚ÄòBefore‚Äô period when we lived in the U.S. and the Nani we recall is from her brief visits to Houston, and our brief visits to Mumbai.  The ‚ÄòAfter‚Äô Nani is after we returned to Mumbai.

The Nani of the Before period I cherish most had a divine voice and sang bhajans.  We attended a music contest where she sang like an angel.  Pin drop silence in the packed hall tear, tears in some people‚Äôs eyes. Of course Nani was awarded first prize.  This was followed by other firsts, solo and with Ashwin.

The bombshell followed  - Nani announced she would only sing English songs, no more Hindi bhajans!  I was devastated (**Expletives deleted **).

These abrupt about turns extended to other areas like food. On one visit to Houston it was love of steak, the next visit she was veg!

Nani has grown into a totally different persona.  The After Nani is a glam young  lady with sophisticated tastes.  She loves art, books, travel (I will remain silent on her dubious choice of music) and it is a delight discussing these subjects with her.  Her term in Rome and travels in Europe have done wonders.  The experiences in different places with different people have broadened her knowledge and interests.

So now we have Nani on her 21st, a milestone in her life.  Nurtured by love and affection from the family, enriched with knowledge gained from academics and real life experiences from travels, Nani is well prepared for life ahead.  Nani, we wish you all the best, wish you success in all your endeavors.  We love you so..oh much</p>

            <p class="fragment fade-in scrollable">Nandeeta gave us all scare even before she was born! Preeti had come to Houston on a short trip and the day she was to fly back, she was in tears when she awoke, saying something didn‚Äôt feel right with the baby. Panic stricken, I made a call to a leading gynecologist friend just as she was leaving to attend a day-long meeting. Fortunately I caught her just in time and she was able to make arrangements to admit Preeti in the hospital. After a few tests and medications Preeti came home the next day but was not able to fly for a couple of days. After her return, she was confined to bed for the rest of her pregnancy. And so Nandeeta made her presence felt even before she was born.

When they returned to California, she was the queen of the family, and still is! Pretty clothes were her thing from the time she learnt to walk, and she would change several times a day, into anything that struck her at that moment. One afternoon she swept into the room in a swim suit and a few minutes later it was a tutu. Yet, in spite of her clothes fetish, she had an aversion to being photographed. Not just studio pictures, but family wedding photos or fun times in the park ‚Äì if she saw a camera  she made sure she was nowhere near it. It‚Äôs very different now!

Nani‚Äôs food preferences have always been a mystery to me. I remember one particular episode at an Indian restaurant in Houston when she was around 3 or 4. We ordered plain dal and rice for her. But the dal had jeera in the tadka. She absolutely refused to touch it and ate plain steamed rice instead.

The other side of this wonderful granddaughter is her caring, loving and warm personality. Always an avid reader, she‚Äôs grown into a young lady with a love for art. Both attributes that will stand her in good stead in life. Not to mention her interest in good food and the good life. Friends are her life and she is blessed with a wonderful group she has known from their kindergarten days, and I have no doubt this band of 8 will sustain each other for life.

Dearest Nani, as you stand on the cusp of young womanhood and transition into the real world of the working woman, may this year lead into a life of fulfilled dreams, happiness and love. Be passionate about what you do, always look ahead and always be positive. Life is a joyful journey ‚Äì ENJOY it. Love you muchos.</p>

          <p class="fragment fade-in scrollable">Dear Vagina-ree

          Never in a million years did I think that the girl that was friends with my messiest roommate would end up being one of my best friends. You went from friend of my messiest roommate to becoming my messiest roommate and for that you have my infinite respect.

          We have shared countless crazy memories together and your carefree spirit and unrelenting charisma and joy are at the heart of it. Here‚Äôs a catalogue of some of my favorites: convincing me you and Simran were trying out for acapella, calling an uber SUV and making us spend $200, waking up with cups stacked on me in Fullerton, being covered in paint, sweat, and beer at Sammy, Coachella x 2, being my brown nun, Frank Ocean at FYF, Spice girls on halloween, getting piss-drunk at DKA parties, hot tubbing at Da Vinci, being in my Fauxtalia doc and being impossibly charismatic :), We Love Jay Kane, and especially just the times we spent laying in my bed watching stupid TV.

          People always say, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be best friends forever,‚Äù but I don‚Äôt feel need to say that to you because to say that would mean that there was the possibility that we wouldn‚Äôt be. Love you forever Nan.

            <p class="scrollable">Dearest Nandeeta,

The winter has passed long and slow without you. There is a vibrancy lacking from our
lives. There is no one giving us our vitamins and lukewarm britta water. All of the days go by without an effervescence that you bring to every day. I will never forget the night you me, Isabel and Jackie traversed all of south central and downtown on the search for nothing in particular. It was the night of our dear friend and your traveling companion, Tucker‚Äôs birthday. We left those festivities and made our way to a frat house, Sigma Chi, if I‚Äôm remembering properly. While that was fun we decided we had seen enough and made our way to Tri-delt. While there we stocked up on snacks and got all the hot sorority gossip we could get our hands on. In the dining room of Tri-delf we heard about an incredible opportunity to go downtown and see Jackie‚Äôs sister‚Äôs boyfriend for a little more party. We hopped in an uber and made our way to the famed medici. That night we discovered the song we would come to know as ‚Äúmoney moves‚Äù by famed hip hop artist, Lil Gigi. Not as we thought Bodak Yellow by nobody Cardi B. Jackie showed us the right way to go. The rest of the night passes in a haze. Something about a dive bar and drinking on the street. I don‚Äôt remember exactly what happened. It was a wild night, but typical of time spent with Nandeeta. Fun, incredible and memorable (except for some parts of course).

We can‚Äôt wait for you to come home, without the peace keeper and the life of the party there is something missing in our every day. You are by far the funniest stand up we have ever seen, if not the funniest person. Even though I did not see you every day, I missed you every day. There‚Äôs one less taurus in my life without you here and I simply cannot have that anymore. Happy Birthday and come home soon.

Love Always Kathryn</p>

Man I cannot believe our little baby is 21! I couldn't be prouder of the beautiful, strong, intelligent, independent and wonderfully weird person you've grown into. Here's to many more years of you bullying (mainly ashwin) and amusing us all with your moonsigns and absurd kinds of milk.

          <p class="scrollable">The first time I met Nandeeta was in Fluor Tower early freshman year. I was in the second floor lounge eating cupcakes with our RA, and she walked by with our friend Jack and briefly said hi. We became casual friends, hanging out sometimes in the dining hall or at parties, but I don‚Äôt think I knew her very well until that winter. We had been talking about how much we wanted to go to Runyon Canyon on a hike but no one would go with us, and she had said we should go together. I agreed, assuming that like most plans made freshman year it would never happen. Then she texted me asking if that weekend worked, and I said yes, still assuming we probably wouldn‚Äôt end up doing anything; then she came down the hall into my dorm on Valentine‚Äôs Day and asked when I‚Äôd be ready to leave, while I lay in bed hungover and playing Solitaire on my phone. Nan patiently waited for me to drag myself out of bed, yank a brush through my hair, and find some athleisure at the bottom of my drawer that I could wear out of the house, and the whole time I was thinking ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe she‚Äôs making me actually go hiking.‚Äù So that was the first thing I learned about Nandeeta: when she says she wants to do something, she means it, and she‚Äôll make it happen.

The second thing I learned was that she did NOT know where she was going because we got EXTREMELY lost and fully almost died multiple times in the wilds of Los Angeles. My phone died about halfway in, but we kept going and talked for three hours straight about everything we had ever done until we decided to go home and realized we had no idea how to get there. As the sun set we were walking down a hill calling Uber after Uber, not making it to any of them. Her phone was on maybe 2% as we called another, trying to figure out what we would do when her phone died and we were stranded by the side of the road; when we finally made it, I thought I was gonna cry in relief. Overall I feel like that day with Nan was like when they fight the troll in Harry Potter: after that we just had to be friends.

I have a lot of other great Nan stories from all the other silly adventures we‚Äôve gone on, from Coachella to Beverly Hills. Nandeeta is generous, honest, and fun; she is smart, snarky, and easy to be friends with. One time I locked us in the supply closet at Social Work while we were working and lost the key and she didn‚Äôt even get angry with me. She‚Äôs the only person I know who has ordered just a cup of hot water at a restaurant because she‚Äôs cold. She is one of my favorite people in the world and I‚Äôm SO glad she forced me to go to Runyon Canyon that Valentine‚Äôs Day.

You're one of my oldest, longest and dearest friends and I couldn't be happier. There's no one else I'd rather be mistaken for, my twin, because you're absolutely stunning (inside and out) üíï I've known you pretty much all my life and I can't imagine growing up without our sleepovers, and your obsession with chocolate and plain pasta (this one still baffles me)...

I absolutely love that we reconnect on Ganpati of all days! Seeing your mum nudge you to pray to the idol before we can run off and start gossiping is honestly such a highlight. We have too many other memories to go through so I'm not even going to try. But just know that I can't wait to reconnect with you the next time we're home together - it's high time we make some new memories to cherish!

You are literally a gem of a human being. You're so much fun to be with and you're always so positive and upbeat that simply seeing your face brightens my day. I love how thoughtful, caring and supportive you are with your loved ones. You have like a billion friends, and I'm just so happy to be one of them!

We may not cross paths for months on end, but just know that I always think of you most fondly and I will always be here for you when you need me üíñ

Love you forever,

Aaj Nandeeta ke janam divas par lekar nayi Umang....
This is just a sneak peak of the birthday song I learnt in JB. The school I was from before you knew me and from when you though I was a freak...
Okay let me start by saying I totally became friends with you because I needed your house to lead a super scandalous life. Jk.
Tbh I never though we‚Äôd be friends cause you moved your bum way too much when you walked and I don‚Äôt gel with bitches.
I was wrong. I mean you still are a bitch but I give you permission because once a very wise person told me ( yes that wise person was you ) that absence makes the heart grow fonder, and bitchiness makes your friendship stronger.
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve had crazier memories with anyone else. From squad to D and K and that movie we went for together and every single thing that went down in your house- you made those 2 years so exciting. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd have gotten through school without you, and despite all the Mayadas and Joshua‚Äôs, you really made the whole thing worth it.
Thank you for always giving me the best advice ( which I never ended up listening to ), giving me a home every weekend, and of course giving me your parents who opened doors for me at 6 am when I‚Äôm in the middle of a crisis ( Priti and Stanis are another reason I‚Äôm friends with you ).
Even though you literally SUCK at keeping in touch, like you‚Äôre worse than me and that‚Äôs really saying something, I‚Äôll always consider you one of my bestest friends.
Miss you like crazy nandit. It would be great if you remembered me sometimes but your absence has only made my heart grow fonder ;)
Here‚Äôs to many more years of you ragging me and a thousand more memories ‚Äòdear‚Äô.
Happy 21st, I love you!!!!</p>

Today you are 21! Happy birthday!üéâ
You have grown and matured into a beautiful, spirited young woman, and I am so proud of the person you are today. You are kind, independent and loyal to those you love. Your zest for life and ability to laugh are just wonderful. You have taught me to me more tolerant and less judgmental...... and live a little!

Looking back on the last 21 years I have great memories of you in nursery school and with your baby group friends, in Menlo Park at the duck pond. Your beautiful singing winning many competitions, your crazy food habits, your love for sleep! Your temper tantrums and moodiness! Fearless Bungee jumping and sky diving!
We have had many great times.... on holidays, shopping together, watching TV shows and movies, coffee and chats at KGC, spa times, your special 16th birthday in Santorini......and then there were the times when you hated me, and I was the annoying mom! I‚Äôm sorry if I hurt you..... that was not my intent.

You are now entering a new phase in your life. Your values and beliefs will guide you and keep you grounded. Listen to your inner voice and your gut.... or maybe in your case not your gut so much!! üòÄ
Be true to yourself .... be the bigger person and hold your head up high. Integrity, compassion and empathy are never overrated. Respect people and relationships.

You‚Äôve had an amazing semester in Rome..... just before your 21st birthday....a time you will always remember. And yet, the best is still to come. Work hard, dream big... be happy! Sing!!

Nani, you are the best daughter......I love the way you spoil me..... and a caring sister. I know how much you love Ashwin.... friends will come and go, he will always be there for you. Nurture this bond.

Please look after yourself and your health. Make gratitude and prayer a part of your life.

Nandeeta, I am truly blessed to have you in my life. I will always always have your back.
I love you forever. ‚ù§Ô∏è

          <p class="fragment fade-in scrollable">My Dear Nandeeta,
Happy 21st to my mad, schizophrenic, loving, obstinate, fun-loving, pig-headed, guffawing, confident, vulnerable, smart, thrill-seeking, caring, darling baby.

I‚Äôm so proud of the way you‚Äôve developed into a confident, go-getting young woman who knows what she wants and tries hard to get it.  The key is to keep working towards your goals and not give up.
When you were younger, I used to worry about how to connect with you, but am so very happy that we‚Äôve found many things to share such as food, wine, reading, music and travel.

As I looked through old pictures to create a photo album for your birthday, I was reminded of the wonderful times we have spent together as a family, whether at home or on holidays in Kashmir, South Africa, Italy, the US, Mexico, etc.   We must all promise ourselves that we will work hard to maintain our relationships with each other.

The happiness on our faces reflected in the photographs reminded me that we have much to be thankful for.  I am proud and happy that you have in the past chosen to contribute your time to improving the lives of those who are not as fortunate as we are.  I hope you continue your efforts.

Finally, as I thought about this missive, the song ‚ÄúMaria‚Äù from Sound of Music instantly came to my mind.  Here it is, suitably edited:

‚ÄúHow do you solve a problem like Nandeeta?‚Ä®
How do you catch a cloud and pin it down?‚Ä®
How do you find the word that means Nandeeta?‚Ä®
A flibbertijibbet! A will-o'-the wisp! A clown!

Many a thing you know you'd like to tell her‚Ä®
Many a thing she ought to understand‚Ä®
But how do you make her stay and listen to all you say‚Ä®
How do you keep a wave upon the sand?

Oh, how do you solve a problem like Nandeeta?‚Ä®
How do you hold a moonbeam in your hand?‚Ä®
Unpredictable as weather, she's as flighty as a feather‚Ä®
She's a darling! She's a demon! She's a lamb!

She'd out pester any pest, drive a hornet from its nest‚Ä®
She could throw a whirling dervish out of whirl‚Ä®
She is gentle! She is wild! She's a riddle! She's a child!‚Ä®
She's a headache! She's an angel! She's a girl!‚Äù

Keep being you.
With All My Love,
Dad</p>

            <p class="scrollable">Dear Nan, I can‚Äôt begin to explain how glad I am that you were truly so terrible at math. I have no idea when we actually became friends or how we reached the stage where it was casual for me to be skipping in your nani‚Äôs house, but I am grateful for everything in between. You never fail to make me laugh, whether its your driving skills, Hollywood hikes or New Year adventures. If theres one thing I love about our friendship, is that it translates across time, distance and several ignored texts just to be as sparkly, new and full of life when we meet next. Thanks for always being an amazing friend from the very first Loco Chino kidnapping. I know I can turn to you for all the bad decisions, all the laughs, all the almond cakes and always one more shot. Happy 21st nani, I already know its going to be the best one. ‚Äì Shayra</p>

            <p class="fragment fade-in scrollable">You have made my life 10000 times better. Thanks for a million amazing memories. Continue being the crazy, hilarious and fun loving person that you are.

I hope you have a brilliant 21st and that you mature a little bit as you enter adulthood. As you grow old and wisdomous, I‚Äôd like to remind of some of the life lessons we have learnt over the years:

When staying in a hotel, don‚Äôt prank call the reception from the hotel room phone. However if you get yourself into this situation, remember to play it dumb- ‚ÄúWho could it be?‚Äù

Always remember to ‚Äúhide the red‚Äù in a rural area. Save yourself from bulls.

Although most people would love having a song written for them, not everyone is as appreciative. Choose your subject wisely.

When a teacher is yelling at you, don‚Äôt make eye contact. Simply look away and pretend you don‚Äôt know who she‚Äôs talking to.

Forget slow and steady wins the race. The tortoise was actually very sly and tricked the hare into losing.
If you don‚Äôt check up on Preeti and Dinesh before an event, they will be color coordinated.

If you ever need someone to be there, call me.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY BENJIE!</p>

It's funny but a lot of you reminds me of me when I was your age. I love your craziness and madness especially in front of your mom. Hahaha.

You have been an essential and important part of tias life. Love that you'll spent time in Sicily as these are the most precious moments you will never forget.

Honestly where do I even begin? You and I have gone through so so many strange stages and phases of our lives together- woodlands and ‚Äôsnail‚Äô and chocolate chip pancakes phase, your vegetarian phase (my personal fav), the stage of taking a million tuitions together and getting hit by bikes (!?), Jalan-Vaswani dins, the violence and the fights, the bus rides and shenanigans, Venice Beach and Disney fun, the sleepovers, and just a million (difficult or inappropriate to express) memories in between. It sucks that I see you like once a year now, and that we both are the worst at keeping in touch, but honestly, I love how even when we do meet for that one day it feels like nothing has changed. I really miss hanging out with you and talking to and fighting with you everyday, and idk if that will ever happen again, but you should know that you and our friendship mean so so much to me. Your spunk, tantrums, spontaneity, fierceness, and ability to do anything you set your mind to continues to inspire me even from 10000 miles away. I truly hope you are having the most incredible 21st in Italy (ugh I‚Äôm so mad we couldn‚Äôt meet), and doing some bat-shit crazy Nandeeta stuff that I probably would disapprove of. Have the best year ahead, love you so so much ‚ù§ ‚ù§ ‚ù§</p>

The chapter which saw us watch Ananya grow from a little infant to a teenager to finally an adult. It is impossible for me to think of these years without fondly recalling beautiful memories of watching you and Ashwin grow up too. Honestly if I had to think of all the happy memories of toddler days, sunflower and big school days, times spent just unwinding and gossiping at home here, outings, tuitions, our gr8 family times and much more, I could write a book! The walk down this memory lane is heartwarming most of all. I feel proud when I think that the baby steps we watched in the Woodlands garden were shaping a surefooted , strong willed and confident woman. Nanni, you always immersed yourself into anyone‚Äôs needs and occasions (a special memory is of you and Ananya plotting her ‚Äòsurprise‚Äô bday party!) . Your ability to lend a unique , empathetic, funny and creative dimension to an event is something which will always hold you in good stead.Its your great strength!
So here‚Äôs wishing an intelligent , fun loving , adventurous , talented and beautiful young adult a wonderful time on her milestone birthday ! May it be full of joy and laughter . Would love to see you more often Nanni and we look forward to having you home and celebrating over a glass of cold coffee!!Love you and God bless you always.

Happy 21st Birthday. You can finally legally do all the things you have already been doing since you were 10!!!!

I don‚Äôt even know where to begin with you because there is so much to say. You have brought so much joy in my life and I cannot imagine having half the adventures I do without you. I am so lucky for our library dates that made us so close & even luckier that I get to call you one of my closest friends today.  Your spirit or adventure and carefree personality is something that is very rare in this world and I hope you remain this way forever because it makes you the special girl that you are.

You are truly one of a kind and I cannot even imagine how boring my life would be without you and your shenanigans. I could have never predicted how strong our relationship has become, but I am eternally grateful for it and for you. And when I tell people about you, it almost always bring a smile to my face because you are truly a crazy gal. Just a reminder today that you are incredibly kind, you always know how to make me laugh, you are courageous in a way that I cannot even begin to explain and I am beyond lucky I have you in my life.

Have the best day my Nan, living it up in the best way you know how. I wish I could be with you today! I love you immensely</p>

Nandeeta, Nandeeta
Remember when I met her?
She said
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go to 1 Oak‚Äù
But little did I know
She would be the One, oh
To steal my heart

Nandeeta, Nandeeta
Remember living in Da Vinci?
Nope, me neither

Nandeeta, Nandeeta
Flower headdresses, lobster Mac
We saw Lorde, I never wanted to go back
Coachella ‚Äî it was a good time

Hearing you jump rope above me
There‚Äôs no place I‚Äôd rather be
Cooking Bhel Purri
For my stupid documentary

Than, she left for Rome
No! Please come home
Looking forward to the memories
To come

            <p class="fragment fade-in scrollable">Dear Nandeeta,

First of, we all really miss you(even Ashwin although he is too cool to admit it sometimes). Second, one of the most exciting birthdays is upon you, seriously. Your 21st year marks the beginning of a wildly exciting time, aside from trying your first sip of alcohol (I have got some great suggestions on what you could try first, hmu!) it also the time for great growth. I remember my 21st birthday as the year before you graduate college and then get to live your life! Trust me, many people say that college is the best years of your life, but if you think about your life a sa whole sum of parts and experiences, college is such a small fraction of it, that there is much more to see and explore. I guess my birthday message is slowly turning into some sort of life advice, which I am ok with, and I hope you are too :) But I must tell you that the most fruitful, prodictive, and amazing years are before you. Make sure to continue grabbing life by you know what and seizing every moment and opportunity, connceting with amazing people, traveling the world, laughing a ton, crying a ton (because emotions are a good thing), and never being apologetic for being yourself.

You are a light that shines on everyone. You are kind, motivated, driven, loving, and hilarious! Your sass, sarcasm, and a sense of humor is a triple threat. Your energy is contagious and every time we hang out together I feel happy, uplifted, empowered (because you help me make fun of Ashwin), and I ALWAYS have a strong urge to shop. You are the only human being on this planet that has this effect on me. Additionally,I can see you becoming an independant, strong willed, and ambitious woman. This is a good thing because strenght of character is important as is strong work ethic, both of which you possess.

I do not want to make this birthday message too long or too philosophical (since you have not graduated college yet and your senior year is upon you so you must prepare your liver), but I will leave it as this...The meaning of life is to give life meaning, so no matter what you do, make sure you find yours.

Happy Birthday dear Nani, I must buy you a drink when you are back <3</p>

            <p class="fragment fade-in scrollable">Not many people I know are as fun-loving as Nandeeta, and that easily makes her stand out. She brings so much positivity into the lives of everyone around her, which really makes her special.
She‚Äôs one of my oldest and closest friends and even though we live so far away from each other and don‚Äôt talk much, I know she‚Äôll always have my back because of the kind of person she is.
One of my favourite memories of her was when she tried to convince both of our parents that we were dating, which we thought would really horrify them. It didn‚Äôt. But the whole episode was so funny.
She‚Äôs definitely one of the people I look forward to seeing the most when I come back to Bombay.</p>

            <p class="fragment fade-in scrollable">Why I Love Nans (or, ‚ÄúThe Mysteries of Nans‚Äù)

- How she can pout and scowl in pictures as a kid AND preen and pose in pictures as an adult

- How she incurred loud yells of ‚ÄúNANDEETA!‚Äù from her parents as a kid AND how she incurs purrs of affection and acquiescence as an adult from the same

- How she is equally comfortable taking Uber for an hour long journey to Orange County AND walking long distances in the streets of Menlo Park  and Palo Alto when she has no car

- How she likes steaks/fries AND various healthy concoctions that look god-awful

- How she showed up for a USC football game dressed as a USC song-girl AND how she didn‚Äôt bother watching the game because she doesn‚Äôt know anything about football

- How she taught me about Shark Tank AND how some day we both expect that she will be a judge on the show

- AND, finally, how she makes us all laugh!

            <p class="fragment fade-in scrollable">Dear Nani,

          Happy Birthday!!! I hope you have an amazing birthday and wish I could be with you to celebrate. I am so glad you are finally 21 -- let's celebrate in Napa and this time we will both have IDs ;) I feel so lucky that you're living in CA now and I have more opportunities to see you. In the past year we've been together in Nashville, Ashville, LA, Menlo Park, and Bombay and I look forward to many more years of travel together.

          You bring so much fun  and love to our family. Your playful spirit and ability to make everyone laugh are unparalleled. We really missed you when we were together in SF last week, it felt much quieter without you.

          You feel more like a peer than a younger cousin, and I love being able to hang out with you, whether it‚Äôs shopping in Bombay, hanging in Menlo Park, or driving to LA together. I don‚Äôt know what I would do without your skincare (and hair removal lol) advice.

          Nani you are a warm, loving, enthusiastic person and such a special part of our family. I wish you the happiest of birthdays and hope that you have fun celebrating. I love you so much and hope I can see you this summer!

          Love,
          Nina</p>

          <p class="fragment fade-in scrollable">Holy crap I can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre 21!!?! Half of me is so unbelievably surprised you‚Äôre ONLY 21 and the other half can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôve managed to fool everyone for this long üòú

But for real this last week has been such a nostalgic time for me. I got a chance to look over all our old memories together and remember some of the fun, silly, and straight up ridiculous experiences we‚Äôve had. From ice skating & cooking with Dadiji in Houston, to hangin‚Äô with T-Swift in Carnegie Deli, to cheetah petting and bungee jumping off the highest bridge in South Africa, to making pasta in Italy, to scuba diving in Turkey, to watching Lana Del Rey & the Classic West in LA, to getting absolutely wasted in Napa, to chilling with the yung Vasus in Big Bear, to seeing Kylie at Catch (I would be wearing my flannel right now if I could), to vibin‚Äô at Nikki beach in Miami, to ‚Äòcarrying‚Äô you through the flooded streets of Venice. I could go on forever.

And while we‚Äôve had some of these outrageous and crazy experiences together, some of the memories that stick out the most are ones you may not necessarily call memorable: our dinner at Table, the night I left for college, the drive back together from San Fran, our first sibling dinner, High School Musical, Pitch Perfect, Friends, & New Girl, bringing you meds at USC because you can‚Äôt even move from couch, the countless drives filled with throwback and bollywood music, grabbing pie with me in the middle of the night to cheer me up, the first time you drove my car. I could also go on forever here too.

Since it‚Äôs your 21st let me give you some advice for your future. Never stop experiencing things in life. No matter what happens, always stay close to the family. Nothing is more important. Keep in touch with the people you love the most, you might regret losing some crucial friendships when it‚Äôs too late. Work for something that you‚Äôre passionate about ‚Äì not just for the lifestyle that you want to have. Don‚Äôt be scared to be open and vulnerable to love. Because not only does it teach you more about yourself, but it can also be the best thing to ever happen to you. Ok enough ‚Äògyaan‚Äô.

You‚Äôve ‚Äòtruly‚Äô become such an incredible human being. Opinionated yet pragmatic, outrageous yet sensible, intelligent yet carefree. You‚Äôre so goddamn hilarious I struggle to come to terms with it sometimes but you really are such a giant source of entertainment in the family. You‚Äôre strong-minded with the will to push yourself for what you want in life. Extremely perceptive of people and their feelings, you‚Äôve for sure got that from Preetz lol.

You‚Äôre incredibly loving and caring, I honestly couldn‚Äôt have ever wished for a better sister. Being with you in LA has brought me so much genuine happiness and joy. I don‚Äôt ever want that to change. I hope we stay close wherever we end up in the future. I mean distance wise btw, I don‚Äôt even need to mention like bond wise cause honestly there‚Äôs no better sibling duo.

Happy 21st,

Love you so so much,
</p>
