From 4th grade to now I have always felt like I could talk to you about anything and you never judge. So sad we aren't seeing each other in Europe but I'm sure you will have the best day!! I love hanging out at your house and eating your food and talking with Shik and Amaesha and you. You made math group so much more fun just like you do with most other events and classes and I'm so happy I have you in my life!!! Happy happy birthday i love you so much xoxoxo Aditi</p>

            <p class="fragment fade-in scrollable">Dear Vagina-ree

Never in a million years did I think that the girl that was friends with my messiest roommate would end up being one of my best friends. You went from friend of my messiest roommate to becoming my messiest roommate and for that you have my infinite respect.

We have shared countless crazy memories together and your carefree spirit and unrelenting charisma and joy are at the heart of it. Here’s a catalogue of some of my favorites: convincing me you and Simran were trying out for acapella, calling an uber SUV and making us spend $200, waking up with cups stacked on me in Fullerton, being covered in paint, sweat, and beer at Sammy, Coachella x 2, being my brown nun, Frank Ocean at FYF, Spice girls on halloween, getting piss-drunk at DKA parties, hot tubbing at Da Vinci, being in my Fauxtalia doc and being impossibly charismatic :), We Love Jay Kane, and especially just the times we spent laying in my bed watching stupid TV.

People always say, “We’ll be best friends forever,” but I don’t feel need to say that to you because to say that would mean that there was the possibility that we wouldn’t be. Love you forever Nan.

Love,
Jackson</p>

          <p class="fragment fade-in scrollable">Nani, Nani, Nani, our darling sweet Nani.  Memories of Nani are plenty both from our ‘Before’ period when we lived in the U.S. and the Nani we recall is from her brief visits to Houston, and our brief visits to Mumbai.  The ‘After’ Nani is after we returned to Mumbai.

The Nani of the Before period I cherish most had a divine voice and sang bhajans.  We attended a music contest where she sang like an angel.  Pin drop silence in the packed hall tear, tears in some people’s eyes. Of course Nani was awarded first prize.  This was followed by other firsts, solo and with Ashwin.

The bombshell followed  - Nani announced she would only sing English songs, no more Hindi bhajans!  I was devastated (**Expletives deleted **).

These abrupt about turns extended to other areas like food. On one visit to Houston it was love of steak, the next visit she was veg!

Nani has grown into a totally different persona.  The After Nani is a glam young  lady with sophisticated tastes.  She loves art, books, travel (I will remain silent on her dubious choice of music) and it is a delight discussing these subjects with her.  Her term in Rome and travels in Europe have done wonders.  The experiences in different places with different people have broadened her knowledge and interests.

So now we have Nani on her 21st, a milestone in her life.  Nurtured by love and affection from the family, enriched with knowledge gained from academics and real life experiences from travels, Nani is well prepared for life ahead.  Nani, we wish you all the best, wish you success in all your endeavors.  We love you so..oh much</p>

            <p class="fragment fade-in scrollable">Nandeeta gave us all scare even before she was born! Preeti had come to Houston on a short trip and the day she was to fly back, she was in tears when she awoke, saying something didn’t feel right with the baby. Panic stricken, I made a call to a leading gynecologist friend just as she was leaving to attend a day-long meeting. Fortunately I caught her just in time and she was able to make arrangements to admit Preeti in the hospital. After a few tests and medications Preeti came home the next day but was not able to fly for a couple of days. After her return, she was confined to bed for the rest of her pregnancy. And so Nandeeta made her presence felt even before she was born.

When they returned to California, she was the queen of the family, and still is! Pretty clothes were her thing from the time she learnt to walk, and she would change several times a day, into anything that struck her at that moment. One afternoon she swept into the room in a swim suit and a few minutes later it was a tutu. Yet, in spite of her clothes fetish, she had an aversion to being photographed. Not just studio pictures, but family wedding photos or fun times in the park – if she saw a camera  she made sure she was nowhere near it. It’s very different now!

Nani’s food preferences have always been a mystery to me. I remember one particular episode at an Indian restaurant in Houston when she was around 3 or 4. We ordered plain dal and rice for her. But the dal had jeera in the tadka. She absolutely refused to touch it and ate plain steamed rice instead.

The other side of this wonderful granddaughter is her caring, loving and warm personality. Always an avid reader, she’s grown into a young lady with a love for art. Both attributes that will stand her in good stead in life. Not to mention her interest in good food and the good life. Friends are her life and she is blessed with a wonderful group she has known from their kindergarten days, and I have no doubt this band of 8 will sustain each other for life.

Dearest Nani, as you stand on the cusp of young womanhood and transition into the real world of the working woman, may this year lead into a life of fulfilled dreams, happiness and love. Be passionate about what you do, always look ahead and always be positive. Life is a joyful journey – ENJOY it. Love you muchos.</p>

Happiest of birthdays to the best girl around. So thankful for our friendship and all the crazy times we share. Bless Jack for sticking you in our Coachella group... I know every time I am going to hang out with you it will be a great time! From LA to Coachella to Berlin to Rome, we only get closer and have more fun! I am so grateful you made me fill out the study abroad application so we could share even more memories on this wild ride. Love you so much! I know you will have the best 21st birthday ever!

            <p class="scrollable">Dearest Nandeeta,

The winter has passed long and slow without you. There is a vibrancy lacking from our
lives. There is no one giving us our vitamins and lukewarm britta water. All of the days go by without an effervescence that you bring to every day. I will never forget the night you me, Isabel and Jackie traversed all of south central and downtown on the search for nothing in particular. It was the night of our dear friend and your traveling companion, Tucker’s birthday. We left those festivities and made our way to a frat house, Sigma Chi, if I’m remembering properly. While that was fun we decided we had seen enough and made our way to Tri-delt. While there we stocked up on snacks and got all the hot sorority gossip we could get our hands on. In the dining room of Tri-delf we heard about an incredible opportunity to go downtown and see Jackie’s sister’s boyfriend for a little more party. We hopped in an uber and made our way to the famed medici. That night we discovered the song we would come to know as “money moves” by famed hip hop artist, Lil Gigi. Not as we thought Bodak Yellow by nobody Cardi B. Jackie showed us the right way to go. The rest of the night passes in a haze. Something about a dive bar and drinking on the street. I don’t remember exactly what happened. It was a wild night, but typical of time spent with Nandeeta. Fun, incredible and memorable (except for some parts of course).

We can’t wait for you to come home, without the peace keeper and the life of the party there is something missing in our every day. You are by far the funniest stand up we have ever seen, if not the funniest person. Even though I did not see you every day, I missed you every day. There’s one less taurus in my life without you here and I simply cannot have that anymore. Happy Birthday and come home soon.

Love Always Kathryn</p>

I’ve known you for 21 years today ❤️ you were one of the cheekiest ( pun intended you know which cute baby picture I’m referring to )and cutest kids I’ve ever known . Your confidence in yourself has always inspired me to be less conscious and embrace myself the way that I am. Some of my fondest memories stem from the stories you told us at our sleepovers and the crazy time we had during the school play in 2006! sleepovers and swim sessions with you have always been the most fun nanban - and ofcourse our crazy practice sessions for encore . We had so much fun in 10th grade goa - playing monopoly and what not hahah . You’re one of the most empathetic and genuine people that I know . You have the ability to light up a room just by walking inside of it . Your voice is almost as beautiful as you are 💫 I’m really thankful to have you in my life nan , you’re the right amount of crazy I needed in my life - growing up without that would just be too boring . Thanksgiving was extra special because I got to spend it with your family and it was beautiful ! Thank you for always being there for me and for the overflow of carrot muffins in the 9th grade! I love you so much nan , always , no matter what you’re super super important to me and nothing will ever change that ❤️ I hope you have the craziest day can’t wait to hug you when you’re home 💕🦋 always stay the carefree , wild and beautiful human being that you are !</p>

Man I cannot believe our little baby is 21! I couldn't be prouder of the beautiful, strong, intelligent, independent and wonderfully weird person you've grown into. Here's to many more years of you bullying (mainly ashwin) and amusing us all with your moonsigns and absurd kinds of milk.

          <p class="scrollable">The first time I met Nandeeta was in Fluor Tower early freshman year. I was in the second floor lounge eating cupcakes with our RA, and she walked by with our friend Jack and briefly said hi. We became casual friends, hanging out sometimes in the dining hall or at parties, but I don’t think I knew her very well until that winter. We had been talking about how much we wanted to go to Runyon Canyon on a hike but no one would go with us, and she had said we should go together. I agreed, assuming that like most plans made freshman year it would never happen. Then she texted me asking if that weekend worked, and I said yes, still assuming we probably wouldn’t end up doing anything; then she came down the hall into my dorm on Valentine’s Day and asked when I’d be ready to leave, while I lay in bed hungover and playing Solitaire on my phone. Nan patiently waited for me to drag myself out of bed, yank a brush through my hair, and find some athleisure at the bottom of my drawer that I could wear out of the house, and the whole time I was thinking “I can’t believe she’s making me actually go hiking.” So that was the first thing I learned about Nandeeta: when she says she wants to do something, she means it, and she’ll make it happen.

The second thing I learned was that she did NOT know where she was going because we got EXTREMELY lost and fully almost died multiple times in the wilds of Los Angeles. My phone died about halfway in, but we kept going and talked for three hours straight about everything we had ever done until we decided to go home and realized we had no idea how to get there. As the sun set we were walking down a hill calling Uber after Uber, not making it to any of them. Her phone was on maybe 2% as we called another, trying to figure out what we would do when her phone died and we were stranded by the side of the road; when we finally made it, I thought I was gonna cry in relief. Overall I feel like that day with Nan was like when they fight the troll in Harry Potter: after that we just had to be friends.

I have a lot of other great Nan stories from all the other silly adventures we’ve gone on, from Coachella to Beverly Hills. Nandeeta is generous, honest, and fun; she is smart, snarky, and easy to be friends with. One time I locked us in the supply closet at Social Work while we were working and lost the key and she didn’t even get angry with me. She’s the only person I know who has ordered just a cup of hot water at a restaurant because she’s cold. She is one of my favorite people in the world and I’m SO glad she forced me to go to Runyon Canyon that Valentine’s Day.

You're one of my oldest, longest and dearest friends and I couldn't be happier. There's no one else I'd rather be mistaken for, my twin, because you're absolutely stunning (inside and out) 💕 I've known you pretty much all my life and I can't imagine growing up without our sleepovers, and your obsession with chocolate and plain pasta (this one still baffles me)...

I absolutely love that we reconnect on Ganpati of all days! Seeing your mum nudge you to pray to the idol before we can run off and start gossiping is honestly such a highlight. We have too many other memories to go through so I'm not even going to try. But just know that I can't wait to reconnect with you the next time we're home together - it's high time we make some new memories to cherish!

You are literally a gem of a human being. You're so much fun to be with and you're always so positive and upbeat that simply seeing your face brightens my day. I love how thoughtful, caring and supportive you are with your loved ones. You have like a billion friends, and I'm just so happy to be one of them!

We may not cross paths for months on end, but just know that I always think of you most fondly and I will always be here for you when you need me 💖

Love you forever,

Radhika

Every time she walks in she brings a smile on everyone’s face.

And she is a foodie! It is such a pleasure to see her enjoy some of my cooking!

Surinder , Nana , too just loved having her around ! Often they shared a secret and teased me !! They also shared a love for Pepperoni Pizza and ate it every now and then!! Playing carrom  was always a welcome activity And I still treasure her art work on cards for Nana and me !

Nandeeta is now a very gracious young lady who loves fun activities . Her travels in Europe,  in the last two months , are going to enrich her life and make her wiser and grounded!! She is already very capable!  Bless her.

Aaj Nandeeta ke janam divas par lekar nayi Umang....
This is just a sneak peak of the birthday song I learnt in JB. The school I was from before you knew me and from when you though I was a freak...
Okay let me start by saying I totally became friends with you because I needed your house to lead a super scandalous life. Jk.
Tbh I never though we’d be friends cause you moved your bum way too much when you walked and I don’t gel with bitches.
I was wrong. I mean you still are a bitch but I give you permission because once a very wise person told me ( yes that wise person was you ) that absence makes the heart grow fonder, and bitchiness makes your friendship stronger.
I don’t think I’ve had crazier memories with anyone else. From squad to D and K and that movie we went for together and every single thing that went down in your house- you made those 2 years so exciting. I don’t think I’d have gotten through school without you, and despite all the Mayadas and Joshua’s, you really made the whole thing worth it.
Thank you for always giving me the best advice ( which I never ended up listening to ), giving me a home every weekend, and of course giving me your parents who opened doors for me at 6 am when I’m in the middle of a crisis ( Priti and Stanis are another reason I’m friends with you ).
Even though you literally SUCK at keeping in touch, like you’re worse than me and that’s really saying something, I’ll always consider you one of my bestest friends.
Miss you like crazy nandit. It would be great if you remembered me sometimes but your absence has only made my heart grow fonder ;)
Here’s to many more years of you ragging me and a thousand more memories ‘dear’.
Happy 21st, I love you!!!!</p>

Today you are 21! Happy birthday!🎉
You have grown and matured into a beautiful, spirited young woman, and I am so proud of the person you are today. I clearly remember the day you were born and how happy I was to have a daughter. My prayers were answered!

Looking back on the last 21 years I have great memories of you in nursery school and with your baby group friends, in Menlo Park at the duck pond. Your beautiful singing winning many competitions, your crazy food habits, your love for sleep! Your temper tantrums and moodiness! Fearless Bungee jumping and sky diving!

We have had our share of great times.... on holidays, shopping together, watching TV shows and movies, coffee and chats at KGC.....and times when you hated me, and I was the annoying mom. I’m sorry if I hurt you..... that was not my intent. Sometimes being a mom is challenging! You have taught me to be more tolerant and less judgmental.

You are now entering a new phase in your life. Your values and beliefs will guide you and keep you grounded. Listen to your inner voice and your gut.... or maybe in your case not your gut so much!! 😀
Be true to yourself .... be the bigger person and hold your head up high. Integrity, Compassion and empathy are never overrated. Respect people and relationships.

You’ve had an amazing semester in Rome..... just before your 21st birthday....a time you will always remember. And yet, the best is still to come. Work hard, dream big... be happy!

Nani, you are the best daughter and a caring sister. I know how much you love Ashwin.... friends will come and go, he will always be there for you. Nurture this bond.

Look after yourself and your health. Make gratitude and prayer a part of your life.

Nandeeta, I am truly blessed to have you in my life. I will always always have your back.
I love you forever. ❤️

Mom.

I hope you have a brilliant 21st and that you mature a little bit as you enter adulthood. As you grow old and wisdomous, I’d like to remind of some of the life lessons we have learnt over the years:

When staying in a hotel, don’t prank call the reception from the hotel room phone. However if you get yourself into this situation, remember to play it dumb- “Who could it be?”

Always remember to “hide the red” in a rural area. Save yourself from bulls.

Although most people would love having a song written for them, not everyone is as appreciative. Choose your subject wisely.

When a teacher is yelling at you, don’t make eye contact. Simply look away and pretend you don’t know who she’s talking to.

Forget slow and steady wins the race. The tortoise was actually very sly and tricked the hare into losing.
If you don’t check up on Preeti and Dinesh before an event, they will be color coordinated.

If you ever need someone to be there, call me.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY BENJIE!</p>

I was agitated; there was a rock under my ass and Jackie’s face was too close to my own. I huffed and got up and out of the tent. You called after me, “Lina, what are you doing? Don’t sleep outside. You’ll get sick.” And guess what happened. Nandeeta, you’re my psychic Indian princess and I cherish our friendship so much. I love you and when you return from Rome we’re going to do the homecoming scene from Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham. Here’s my favorite Coachella pic of you. xo Lina</p>

Happy 21 st birthday my darling. Have a super year ahead and so many after.

It's funny but a lot of you reminds me of me when I was your age. I love your craziness and madness especially in front of your mom. Hahaha.

You have been an essential and important part of tias life. Love that you'll spent time in Sicily as these are the most precious moments you will never forget.

Feel like you are my daughter always and love being in your company and around your drama.

Stay the mad you for now and forever. Love you madly and so proud of you.

Hugs and a million kisses
Ayesha

My babies, my daughters, my crazy girls, stay together forever.</p>

If I believe in fate it’s because an angel came into my life without whom I really would be so lost. Nan, I value you so much in my life and I can’t imagine it without you and your craziness. I miss you and wish I was there to celebrate your birthday like you have been for mine! I’ve seen you grow into a phenomenal women and I couldn’t be more proud of how strong and independent you are! You are the greatest role model for so many women because you really don’t give a shit and you truly inspire me everyday. You’re going to be great Nani and wherever you live on this planet or whichever dimension in the universe you and I will always be linked! I love you and I hope you have a great day.

          <p class="fragment fade-in scrollable">Nanduuuu sabka Banduuu,

Honestly where do I even begin? You and I have gone through so so many strange stages and phases of our lives together- woodlands and ’snail’ and chocolate chip pancakes phase, your vegetarian phase (my personal fav), the stage of taking a million tuitions together and getting hit by bikes (!?), Jalan-Vaswani dins, the violence and the fights, the bus rides and shenanigans, Venice Beach and Disney fun, the sleepovers, and just a million (difficult or inappropriate to express) memories in between. It sucks that I see you like once a year now, and that we both are the worst at keeping in touch, but honestly, I love how even when we do meet for that one day it feels like nothing has changed. I really miss hanging out with you and talking to and fighting with you everyday, and idk if that will ever happen again, but you should know that you and our friendship mean so so much to me. Your spunk, tantrums, spontaneity, fierceness, and ability to do anything you set your mind to continues to inspire me even from 10000 miles away. I truly hope you are having the most incredible 21st in Italy (ugh I’m so mad we couldn’t meet), and doing some bat-shit crazy Nandeeta stuff that I probably would disapprove of. Have the best year ahead, love you so so much ❤ ❤ ❤</p>

Happy 21st Birthday. You can finally legally do all the things you have already been doing since you were 10!!!!

I don’t even know where to begin with you because there is so much to say. You have brought so much joy in my life and I cannot imagine having half the adventures I do without you. I am so lucky for our library dates that made us so close & even luckier that I get to call you one of my closest friends today.  Your spirit or adventure and carefree personality is something that is very rare in this world and I hope you remain this way forever because it makes you the special girl that you are.

You are truly one of a kind and I cannot even imagine how boring my life would be without you and your shenanigans. I could have never predicted how strong our relationship has become, but I am eternally grateful for it and for you. And when I tell people about you, it almost always bring a smile to my face because you are truly a crazy gal. Just a reminder today that you are incredibly kind, you always know how to make me laugh, you are courageous in a way that I cannot even begin to explain and I am beyond lucky I have you in my life.

Have the best day my Nan, living it up in the best way you know how. I wish I could be with you today! I love you immensely</p>

I still remember all our memories from when we were younger like the secret sleepover (we were so cool) and going on trips to Coonoor together! I think it's safe to say that the one thing that will always bond us together is the fact that our dad's are basically a married couple and went to an Ed Sheeran concert with VIP tickets... without any of us! Jokes apart, I'm so glad that we were your only friends when you came back from the US because the Jhaveri-Vaswani adventures have been so fun over the years (especially our Dinesh ragging dinners!) and I'm so excited for more!

            <p class="fragment fade-in scrollable">Dear Nandeeta,

First of, we all really miss you(even Ashwin although he is too cool to admit it sometimes). Second, one of the most exciting birthdays is upon you, seriously. Your 21st year marks the beginning of a wildly exciting time, aside from trying your first sip of alcohol (I have got some great suggestions on what you could try first, hmu!) it also the time for great growth. I remember my 21st birthday as the year before you graduate college and then get to live your life! Trust me, many people say that college is the best years of your life, but if you think about your life a sa whole sum of parts and experiences, college is such a small fraction of it, that there is much more to see and explore. I guess my birthday message is slowly turning into some sort of life advice, which I am ok with, and I hope you are too :) But I must tell you that the most fruitful, prodictive, and amazing years are before you. Make sure to continue grabbing life by you know what and seizing every moment and opportunity, connceting with amazing people, traveling the world, laughing a ton, crying a ton (because emotions are a good thing), and never being apologetic for being yourself.

You are a light that shines on everyone. You are kind, motivated, driven, loving, and hilarious! Your sass, sarcasm, and a sense of humor is a triple threat. Your energy is contagious and every time we hang out together I feel happy, uplifted, empowered (because you help me make fun of Ashwin), and I ALWAYS have a strong urge to shop. You are the only human being on this planet that has this effect on me. Additionally,I can see you becoming an independant, strong willed, and ambitious woman. This is a good thing because strenght of character is important as is strong work ethic, both of which you possess.

I do not want to make this birthday message too long or too philosophical (since you have not graduated college yet and your senior year is upon you so you must prepare your liver), but I will leave it as this...The meaning of life is to give life meaning, so no matter what you do, make sure you find yours.

Happy Birthday dear Nani, I must buy you a drink when you are back <3</p>
